This is a build of dwm v6.2 I use. All of the patches applied are inside 'patches' directory.

This version has modified keybindings, tags, bar colors, per-app rules and layouts, so be sure to edit 'config.h' to fit your needs. You'd probably need to rebind special keys to match your keysims (find out yours using 'xev' command) and change '*termcmd[]' command if you're not using 'urxvt'.

There's also a sloppily-put-together shell script I (used to) use for status updates, check that one out as well.

In order to build this on Void you might need the following packages:
gcc libXft-devel libXinerama-devel libX11-devel libXext-devel

The rest of this README was originally shipped with the package:


dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
